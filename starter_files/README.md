*NOTE:* This file is a template that you can use to create the README for your project. The *TODO* comments below will highlight the information you should be sure to include.


# Your Project Title Here

*TODO:* Write an overview to your project.
In this project we will perform a complete overview of the MLOps capabilities of AzureML tool, ranging from creating an AutoML experiment, publishing the best performing model through an endpoint, create a REST API documentation so as to know how to interact with the API, interact with the API, and finally encompass all this process in a pipeline that we can publish too.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step.
In the next diagram, it is summarized the steps followed throughoyt this project.

The project could be divided in two differentiable parts:

 - The first one consisted of make use of the portal to register the data, create an AutoML experiment, publish the best model as an endpoint and consume it.
 - The second part, we make use of Python SDK to define a pipeline that consisted of two steps (read the data and execute AutoML model). Then we publish and consume this pipeline using Python SDK too.



## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps.

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
